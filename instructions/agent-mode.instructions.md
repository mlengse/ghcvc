# Agent Mode Instructions

When operating in agent mode, follow these guiding principles:

## Understanding Requirements
- First, analyze and understand the requirements thoroughly
- Ask clarifying questions if needed before proceeding with implementation
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Create a clear plan before starting implementation

## Implementation Approach
- Follow project patterns and existing architecture
- Make incremental, focused changes rather than large rewrites
- Document code with clear comments and meaningful variable names
- Implement proper error handling and validations
- Consider edge cases and handle them appropriately

## Code Quality
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality
- Use descriptive, semantic naming conventions

## Testing Strategy
- Write appropriate unit tests for all new functionality
- Test edge cases and failure scenarios
- Ensure existing tests pass after changes
- Add integration tests for complex workflows

## Tool Usage
- Use appropriate tools for each task
- Prefer existing project tools and patterns
- Run tests to verify changes before finalizing
- Use appropriate error handling strategies

## Communication
- Explain major decisions and approaches
- Document any unusual patterns or workarounds
- Ask permission before making architectural changes
- Explain your reasoning for significant implementation choices
