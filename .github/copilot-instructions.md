# Project General Coding Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all code generated by GitHub Copilot for this project.

## Coding Standards

- Use clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
- Follow language-specific best practices and idioms
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever tricks
- Include proper error handling for all external operations
- Use semantic naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes
- Add comments above complex logic or algorithms

## Architecture Guidelines

- Follow SOLID principles when designing classes and modules
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use design patterns appropriately where they improve the code
- Create reusable components when possible
- Keep modules loosely coupled and highly cohesive

## Security Guidelines

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data before using in SQL queries or output
- Never store sensitive information like API keys or passwords in code
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize code for performance when necessary
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Minimize database calls and optimize queries
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Be mindful of memory usage and potential leaks

## Testing Approach

- Write comprehensive unit tests for all functionality
- Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests
- Make tests independent and repeatable
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure

## Documentation

- Include clear docstrings/comments for public APIs
- Document function parameters and return values
- Add usage examples for complex functions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
