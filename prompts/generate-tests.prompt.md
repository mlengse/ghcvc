# Generate Unit Tests

Generate comprehensive unit tests for the following code. Include tests for:

- Normal operation with expected inputs
- Edge cases and boundary values
- Error scenarios and exception handling
- Any mocking or stubbing of external dependencies

The tests should be:
- Independent and repeatable
- Clearly named to indicate what they're testing
- Follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
- Include setup and teardown as appropriate
- Use appropriate assertions for validation

Use the appropriate testing framework and conventions for the language.
